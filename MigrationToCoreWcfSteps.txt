On Runnning it opens up in browser with url of https://localhost:7012/ and shows "This localhost page can’t be found"
Append your service name as like https://localhost:7012/Service1.svc then it shows the page.
Its wsdl will be https://localhost:7012/Service1.svc?wsdl

On SoapUI , File=>New SOAP Project => Initial WSDL = https://localhost:7012/Service1.svc?wsdl => OK
Then it shows the methods defined in the service.
In tool requests pass parameter as 1 or bool as true , stringvalue as madhu then it works perfectly
